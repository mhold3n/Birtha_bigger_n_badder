description: "Docs and Decision Records: keep README, CHANGELOG, and ADRs current."
globs: ["README.md", "docs/**", "CHANGELOG.md"]
---
## Rules
- Update README with setup, scripts, env vars, and runbook notes for new features.
- Maintain **ADRs** in `docs/adr/` for architectural tradeoffs; link from PRs.
- Keep CHANGELOG human-readable; tie entries to PRs/releases.
- **ADR naming**: `docs/adr/NNNN-<slug>.md`
- **README must include**: Quickstart, Scripts, Env Vars, Runbook (deploy/rollback), Support/Ownership.
- **On architecture changes**: write an ADR and link it in the PR body.
